# geographysite
It's geography site that I am making it's one of my first projects

## Preview
Open `index.html` in your browser to see the title and the second section.

### How it works
 - A small sticky navigation bar appears at the top of the page; it includes `Home` and `About` links that jump to sections on the page.
 - The navigation is styled simply and becomes compact on small screens.

### Try it locally
If you'd like the down arrow to link to a separate HTML page instead of the second section, to add a hamburger menu for the nav on mobile, or to make the nav highlight the active section, tell me and I can implement that.
```
# Open the index directly:
ii .\index.html

# Or serve the folder and browse to http://localhost:8000
python -m http.server 8000
```

If you'd like the down arrow to link to a separate HTML page instead of the second section, or to add a floating nav, tell me and I can implement that.
